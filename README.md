Simple GitHub WebHook receiver
==============

Simple GitHub WebHook receiver is a very simple, small server-side php script that receives and reacts to GitHub WebHook requests.


Install
-------
After downloading this repo you will need to place the files on the server you intent to receive GitHub WebHook request.  Typically you should place this in its own web folder like: /var/www/deploy.mydomain.com

I normally set it up as a subdomain under a domain I own and update the web server and dns to use this setup.  PHP will need to have elevated permissions to utilize the exec function in this script.

Next, you'll need to edit config-sample.php and then save as/rename to config.php.

Docker
------

If you prefer you can also run this as a Docker container. Simply run:

    docker build -t <yourname/repo> .
    docker run -d -P <yourname/repo>

And it should work! You'll have this running on Apache, exposed on some port on your host.
